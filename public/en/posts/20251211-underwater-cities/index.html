    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>Today I&rsquo;m sharing my thoughts on Underwater Cities. It&rsquo;s a card-driven worker placement game about building underwater civilizations. Despite some material quality issues, I really enjoyed this game and immediately wanted to play again after each session.</p>
<h3 id="game-overview">Game Overview
</h3><p>Underwater Cities is a 2018 release for 1–4 players, ages 12+, with a playtime of 80–150 minutes. It was designed by Vladimír Suchý, illustrated by Milan Vavroň and Uildrim, and published by Delicious Games.</p>
<figure><img src="/en/posts/20251211-underwater-cities/underwater-cities-box.jpg"
    alt="Underwater Cities box" width="600"><figcaption>
      <p>Underwater Cities box</p>

</figure>

<h3 id="theme">Theme
</h3><p>In Underwater Cities, players represent the world&rsquo;s brightest minds, selected by the population to help humanity expand. Earth is overpopulated and we&rsquo;re still four decades away from colonizing Mars (still trying to Terraform Mars in another board game 😝). With humanity&rsquo;s rapid growth, underwater cities are the only way to expand our territory and accommodate everyone.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll construct symbiotic cities and facilities to produce food and desalinate water, while creating laboratories to develop new technologies.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-win">How to Win
</h3><p>Victory goes to whoever scores the most points. While you earn some points throughout the game via direct actions and production phases, the bulk of your score comes from end-game scoring with your cities, end-game scoring cards and tiles, plus remaining materials and money.</p>
<h3 id="setup--components">Setup &amp; Components
</h3><p>There&rsquo;s no insert in the box, meaning lots of plastic bags to store everything. This makes setup slow for a game that, with a proper insert, would take 5–8 minutes to set up. It&rsquo;s an excellent candidate for creating my own origami insert! 😝</p>
<p>The material quality is disappointing compared to the gameplay quality. The tokens are poor-quality cardboard, and the player board is a thin sheet of paper. This game deserves better.</p>

<h3 id="gameplay">Gameplay
</h3><p>The game is essentially card placement based, divided into 3 eras with 3–4 rounds each. Each round, you perform 3 actions by placing a token in an available spot on the board, triggering an immediate action. There are 3 different action zones, each color-coded.</p>
<p>When selecting an action, you must also play a card. If the colors match, you can execute the card&rsquo;s action; otherwise, the card is discarded. For instance, if you place your token on a green action space and play a green card, you get both the board action AND the card effect.</p>
<figure><img src="/en/posts/20251211-underwater-cities/play-an-action.jpg"
    alt="Action example" width="400">
</figure>

<p>Action example: Purple player blocks the actions with his token and plays a card. The player will be able to build a symbiotic city and resolve the effect of the card.</p>
<h3 id="card-types">Card Types
</h3><p>There are 5 different card types: immediate effect cards, permanent effect cards, cards with effects activated once per era when triggered on the board, production cards that activate at each era&rsquo;s end, and end-game scoring cards.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are special cards that can include any of the above types but have a cost to play and offer more powerful effects.</p>

</figure>

<p>Throughout the rounds, you&rsquo;ll develop your cities by creating symbiotic cities (domes) and plants attached to those domes. Cities only become productive and count toward your network once connecting tunnels are built.</p>
<h3 id="strategic-combos">Strategic Combos
</h3><p>The game allows for satisfying combos. For example, you might have played an ongoing effect card that allows you to gain credits every time you upgrade a tunnel. Or you can play an action in the green zone that activates that specific action, and with the card effect, you can pay a credit to activate another action from a different zone. These combinations create powerful turns when properly planned.</p>
<h3 id="my-opinion">My Opinion
</h3><p>The solo game is a kind of BYOS. There&rsquo;s no real automa, just a system that blocks your actions in a fixed pattern each round. To win, you need 7 connected cities and a score of 100 points or more.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not usually a huge fan of BYOS games, but this one didn&rsquo;t bother me. The game has a Terraforming Mars feel with its cards, tableau building, and combos.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played twice so far, and I can already say the game is frustrating in the best way possible. I&rsquo;ve lost both times, but instead of feeling defeated, I immediately want to play again. As soon as the game ends, I want to start over.</p>

<h3 id="comparing-my-two-plays">Comparing My Two Plays
</h3><p>I definitely improved between games — my score went from 72 on the first play to 83 on the second. The experience felt completely different because the player boards are asymmetric and I chose a different one for my second game. The cards that came into play were also so different that I needed to adjust to a completely different strategy.</p>
<p>I improved primarily by better utilizing the end-game scoring cards, special cards you can obtain using a specific action space. On my first play, I didn&rsquo;t even consider those cards.</p>
<h3 id="strategic-depth">Strategic Depth
</h3><p>The game is really tight and each move must be carefully considered. During production phases, it seems like you&rsquo;re producing lots of resources, but they&rsquo;re never quite enough. You only have 3 production rounds in the entire game (one at the end of each era), and since you don&rsquo;t play after the last production phase, you really only have 2 productive rounds. You&rsquo;ll need to adjust your strategy based on the cards in your hand.</p>
<h3 id="a-tough-decision">A Tough Decision
</h3><p>For example, in my second play during my last round, I thought I would score better with a particular end-game scoring tile. I realized later that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to fulfill its requirements. This happened because in my last round I focused on another strategy that wasn&rsquo;t that effective — I wanted to do everything but couldn&rsquo;t due to the lack of actions.</p>
<h3 id="expansions">Expansions
</h3><p>Two expansions are available: New Discoveries (2019) and Data Era (2025).</p>
<p>New Discoveries brings improvements that should have been in the base game, including dual-layer player boards. It also adds cards, assistants, starting resources, and a new museum mechanism.</p>
<p>Data Era introduces a new resource type — data discs — which provide additional actions along with new buildings called data centers and a new city type: information cities. These additions provide new scoring opportunities. This expansion also brings material improvements for upgraded facilities.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t own either expansion yet, so I haven&rsquo;t tested them. It&rsquo;s frustrating to have to purchase expansions for better quality materials. Either way, the game is excellent, so I&rsquo;ll most likely purchase them sooner or later.</p>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts
</h3><p><strong>Rating: 8.5 out of 10</strong></p>
<p>Even without being a big fan of BYOS and despite the material quality issues, I will rate this game an 8.5/10. The game is really pleasant to play and really challenging. It&rsquo;s an expert board game that deserves a place in any board gamer&rsquo;s collection.</p>
<p>I was reluctant to try it at first due to its not-so-appealing appearance, but I&rsquo;m really happy I tested it. I recommend it.</p>
