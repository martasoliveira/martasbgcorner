            <description>&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/&#34; alt=&#34;Featured image of post Harmonies – Building Beauty, One Token at a Time&#34; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today I want to talk about a game I don&amp;rsquo;t own, but have already played three times in a row. That says a lot, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it? The game is &lt;strong&gt;Harmonies&lt;/strong&gt;, a beautifully illustrated tile-placement game where you build landscapes and create habitats to attract animals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;game-overview&#34;&gt;Game Overview&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harmonies is a 2024 release for 1 to 4 players, ages 10+, with a playtime of 30 to 45 minutes. It was designed by Johan Benvenuto and illustrated by Maëva da Silva and published by Libellud. The Portuguese version is published by Nebo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The game received a &lt;strong&gt;Spiel des Jahres recommendation in 2024&lt;/strong&gt; and won the &lt;strong&gt;Golden Geek Award for Medium Game of the Year in 2024&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/en/posts/20260227-harmonies/harmonies-box.jpg&#34;&#xA;    alt=&#34;Harmonies box cover&#34; width=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;      &lt;p&gt;Harmonies box cover&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;theme&#34;&gt;Theme&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Harmonies, you are an architect of nature. Your goal is to build beautiful landscapes and create the right habitats to attract animals to your world. Each player works on their own personal board, quietly shaping their own little ecosystem, there is something almost meditative about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-win&#34;&gt;How to Win&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The player with the most points at the end of the game wins. Points come from two sources: your animal cards, and the landscape itself, certain landscapes only score if they are together, like mountains.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;components&#34;&gt;Components&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The components are lovely. The landscape tokens are made of wood, satisfying to handle and stack, yes, some of them stack to create 3D mountains and trees! The animal cards are tarot-sized with beautiful, detailed illustrations. Overall the production quality is high and everything feels intuitive just by looking at it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/en/posts/20260227-harmonies/harmonies-setup.jpg&#34;&#xA;    alt=&#34;Components and Start of the game&#34; width=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;      &lt;p&gt;Components and Start of the game&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/en/posts/20260227-harmonies/harmonies-animal-cards.jpg&#34;&#xA;    alt=&#34;Animal Cards&#34; width=&#34;400&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;      &lt;p&gt;Animal Cards&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;gameplay&#34;&gt;Gameplay&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On your turn, you draft coloured wooden tokens from a shared central supply and place them on your personal map board. The tokens represent different landscape elements, mountains, forests, rivers, and more. The combinations you create will determine which animal cards can settle in your habitat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Animal cards are available in a shared river of five cards throughout the game. Each turn you may take one, but you can only hold four at a time. Each card shows a specific landscape pattern that must be fulfilled on your board. Once the pattern is met, the animal joins your map. If you manage to complete all the animals on a card, you free up a space to claim a new one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The game is easy to learn and quick to teach, around 10 minutes to learn, 5 to explain, which makes it a great option to bring to the table with almost anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/en/posts/20260227-harmonies/harmonies-during-play.jpg&#34;&#xA;    alt=&#34;Center board with tokens selection&#34; width=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;      &lt;p&gt;Center board with tokens selection&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;solo-mode&#34;&gt;Solo Mode&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harmonies includes a solo mode, which I have not yet had the chance to try, but it is definitely on my list!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-experience&#34;&gt;My Experience&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I played Harmonies three times in a row at two players, and enjoyed every single game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I love most is the strategy that quietly builds underneath the accessible surface. The more you play, the more careful you become when drafting tokens and positioning them on your board. You need to anticipate what might come out of the bag, plan ahead, and stay flexible when things don&amp;rsquo;t go your way. No two games feel the same because the animal cards that appear first will naturally pull your strategy in a different direction each time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing worth mentioning: the landscape is quite abstract. If you are into it, you will happily imagine the mountains, the forests, and the river coming to life on your board. If that kind of imaginative immersion is not your thing, it might just feel like coloured tokens on a grid, and that is a fair observation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/en/posts/20260227-harmonies/harmonies-end-of-game.jpg&#34;&#xA;    alt=&#34;End of game&#34; width=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;      &lt;p&gt;End of game&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-rating&#34;&gt;My Rating&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rate: 8 ou of 10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Harmonies is an easy, familiar, and quick game that delivers a genuinely enjoyable experience. The production is beautiful, the gameplay is smooth, and the strategic depth sneaks up on you. It is not the most complex game I have played, but it does not need to be, it earns its score through consistency and charm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-thoughts&#34;&gt;Final Thoughts&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for something accessible, beautiful, and with just enough puzzle to keep things interesting, Harmonies is an easy recommendation. It is the kind of game I would happily play again and again, and one I would not hesitate to teach to new players.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A couple of things to keep in mind before bringing it to the table: the interaction between players is quite low, you can influence others slightly by taking tokens they need, but mostly everyone is focused on their own board. If your group enjoys direct competition, this might feel too peaceful. There is also the card river limitation, with only five animal cards available and no way to refresh them actively, you can sometimes find yourself stuck with cards that don&amp;rsquo;t fit your strategy at all. It forces you to adapt, which can be a good thing, but a dedicated refresh action would be a welcome addition. Finally, players prone to analysis paralysis can slow the game down noticeably.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/en/posts/20260227-harmonies/harmonies-animal-river-cards.jpg&#34;&#xA;    alt=&#34;Animal River Cards&#34; width=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;      &lt;p&gt;Animal River Cards&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;your-turn&#34;&gt;Your Turn&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you played Harmonies? Are you a fan of this kind of peaceful, puzzle-like experience, or do you prefer something with more player interaction?

            <description>&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/&#34; alt=&#34;Featured image of post Tracks: Siren Bay – Review&#34; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;rsquo;m talking about Tracks: Siren Bay, a unique sound-based detective game that caught my attention with its innovative mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tracks: Siren Bay is a cooperative mystery game where you solve cases by listening to audio tracks and following suspects through a city map. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting twist on traditional detective games, though it has some limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;game-overview&#34;&gt;Game Overview&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracks: Siren Bay is a 1–6 player game from 2022 with a playtime of 25–45 minutes for ages 12+. It was designed by Juan Rodriguez and Christian Rubiella, illustrated by Pierô, and published by KYF Edition (French version).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/en/posts/20251214-tracks/box.jpg&#34;&#xA;    alt=&#34;Tracks Siren Bay box&#34; width=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;      &lt;p&gt;Tracks: Siren Bay box&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;theme&#34;&gt;Theme&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You play as freshly graduated police officers nicknamed &amp;ldquo;The Rockies.&amp;rdquo; Your first assignment is the Siren Bay Police Department. Upon arrival, Captain Mia Sanchez welcomes you and explains your role. Siren Bay is a quiet city with few issues, but you&amp;rsquo;ll need to track criminals using an old security system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your office is filled with security camera screens and an audio system. Due to humidity, only 4 cameras work simultaneously. This is where you&amp;rsquo;ll track criminals by listening to sound excerpts and checking camera footage when needed. &lt;strong&gt;Welcome to Siren Bay&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;game-components&#34;&gt;Game Components&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside the box you&amp;rsquo;ll find a large map of Siren Bay, a deck of cards representing security cameras, 15 cases to solve, the rulebook, and a QR code to download the companion app.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/en/posts/20251214-tracks/material.jpg&#34;&#xA;    alt=&#34;Tracks Siren Bay components&#34; width=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;      &lt;p&gt;Game Components&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The app is mandatory to play. The game is only published in a few languages, and English is not included.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/en/posts/20251214-tracks/languages.jpg&#34;&#xA;    alt=&#34;Available languages on app&#34; width=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;      &lt;p&gt;Available Languages on App&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-win&#34;&gt;How to Win&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no traditional win or lose condition. The goal is to solve cases by correctly answering questions about the criminals&amp;rsquo; locations and activities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;gameplay&#34;&gt;Gameplay&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select a case from the 15 available — starting with Case 1 is recommended. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve selected the case in the app, start the audio track. During the first listening, you cannot rewind or advance the track. You need to listen carefully to identify the path followed by the suspects, kidnappers, drug dealers, and other criminals, using only the sounds you hear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The map provides visual clues: parks, churches, football stadiums, schools, and more. Some sounds are difficult to identify on their own. When needed, you can use security camera cards to check specific corners of the city. Is there a coffee shop on that corner? A baby crying? These cameras help clarify ambiguous sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, you can only have 4 security cameras active at the same time. If you need to check another location, you must turn off one of the 4 cameras already in use. This limitation adds strategic thinking to which cameras you keep active and when to switch them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the first listening, you&amp;rsquo;ll answer a question, usually &amp;ldquo;Where can we find the suspects?&amp;rdquo; You then select locations on the app&amp;rsquo;s map to send police units. If you&amp;rsquo;re correct, you solve the case or unlock additional questions. If wrong, you can make additional attempts. You can listen to the track as many times as needed before giving your answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/en/posts/20251214-tracks/example.jpg&#34;&#xA;    alt=&#34;Security cameras during case resolution&#34; width=&#34;400&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;      &lt;p&gt;Security cameras during case resolution&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/en/posts/20251214-tracks/app.jpg&#34;&#xA;    alt=&#34;App audio system&#34; width=&#34;400&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;      &lt;p&gt;App audio system&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-experience&#34;&gt;My Experience&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What attracted me initially was solving mysteries using sound. It&amp;rsquo;s like a Sherlock Holmes game, but you follow an audio track instead of written clues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve played 6 cases so far and enjoyed them all. I didn&amp;rsquo;t solve every case on my first try — the difficulty varies significantly. In some cases, I had to listen to the soundtrack a dozen times before spotting the correct path. It was challenging but fun, and I&amp;rsquo;m curious about what the remaining 9 cases have in store.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;sound-quality&#34;&gt;Sound Quality&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sound quality is really good, which is essential for a game built entirely around audio clues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;variety-in-scenarios&#34;&gt;Variety in Scenarios&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One scenario required heavy reliance on security cameras to identify sounds: a coffee shop, a street band, a barking dog, a crying baby, an ice cream truck&amp;rsquo;s music. It was amusing to discover that suspects don&amp;rsquo;t always travel by car (easier to follow due to turn signals) — sometimes they use bicycles!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The scenarios I&amp;rsquo;ve tested are quite variable with increasing difficulty, which keeps things interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;comparison-with-other-detective-games&#34;&gt;Comparison with Other Detective Games&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When compared to Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective, Sherlock is better with more complicated and intricate cases. The mysteries in Sherlock Holmes are more interesting overall. Even so, Tracks: Siren Bay has its own appeal thanks to its unique sound-based mechanism and its accessibility as a family game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;language-dependency&#34;&gt;Language Dependency&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game is not heavily language-dependent, but you still need to understand some French (or whichever language version you have) to catch certain clues, like door numbers, &amp;ldquo;turn right&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;turn left&amp;rdquo; directions, or bits of conversation. In my case, the game is in French, and as a French speaker, this wasn&amp;rsquo;t a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;player-count&#34;&gt;Player Count&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game is really enjoyable solo. I haven&amp;rsquo;t tested it at higher player counts yet, but I imagine it would be fun. Everyone perceives sounds differently and has different sensitivities, which could lead to interesting discussions and collaborative problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;app-dependency--my-main-concern&#34;&gt;App Dependency – My Main Concern&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app dependency is the main reason for not giving a higher rating. I enjoyed the game, but I don&amp;rsquo;t like being dependent on technology for board games. I would have preferred if the audio could be downloadable or provided via a dedicated audio pen. Similarly, the case questions and solutions could have been provided in cards or a booklet format.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the app becomes unavailable or unsupported in the future, the game becomes completely unplayable. This is a significant concern for long-term ownership.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;replayability&#34;&gt;Replayability&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After solving all 15 cases, the game has no replay value unless you forget the solutions. Once you know where the criminals are, there&amp;rsquo;s no mystery left to solve.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;final-thoughts&#34;&gt;Final Thoughts&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rating: 7 out of 10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed playing Tracks: Siren Bay and trying to solve its mysteries. Using sound tracks is quite interesting and different from typical detective games. It&amp;rsquo;s accessible enough to be a family game and offers a unique experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the mandatory app dependency and limited replayability are significant drawbacks that prevent me from rating it higher.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d recommend Tracks: Siren Bay to people who enjoy solving mysteries, want to try new mechanics, and don&amp;rsquo;t mind app-dependent games. It&amp;rsquo;s particularly good as a family game or for players new to detective games.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;your-turn&#34;&gt;Your Turn&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you played Tracks: Siren Bay? What did you think of the sound-based mechanics? How many cases have you solved?
